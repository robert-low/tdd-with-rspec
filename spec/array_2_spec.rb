# Create a new ​array_2_spec.rb​ file.

# Create an example group using ​RSpec.describe​ with an argument of ​Array​.

# Invoke the ​subject​ method outside of any example.

# Give the subject a name of ​:sally.

# Inside the block, declare a 2-element array with bracket syntax.

# Add an example that tests that the ​subject​ has a length of 2.

# Invoke the ​pop method to remove an element from the ​subject​ array.

# In the same example, write another assertion to check that the length of the array is now 1.

# In a second, separate example, write an assertion to confirm that ​sally​ is equal to the original array.
